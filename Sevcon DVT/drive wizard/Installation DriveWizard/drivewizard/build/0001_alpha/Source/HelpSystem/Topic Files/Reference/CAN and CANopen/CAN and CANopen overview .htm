<h1>CAN and CANopen: overview
</h1>
<h2>Object Dictionary</h2>
<p align="left">All CANopen devices maintain an area of memory, parts of which
  are accessible to other CANopen devices via the CAN bus. This area of memory
  is known as the Object Dictionary</p>
<p align="left">The CAN node's Object Dictionary is divided into parameters
  of variable type and length e.g. 32 bit unsigned integers, 64 bit Real numbers,
  Unicode
  strings.  </p>
<p align="left"><br>
  To extract individual parameter from the Object Dictionary it is necessary
    to have a description of the type, position and length of each parameter.
      This description is known as the Electronic Data Sheet or EDS. each CAN
      node type
    needs to have its own EDS.</p>
<h2 align="left">Matching an EDS file to an Object Dictionary.</h2>
<p align="left">A few mandatory Object Dictionary parameters have data types,
  position and length pre-defined by CANopen specification. These parameters
  can therefore be reliably read even without an EDS file. </p>
<p align="left">One of these is known s the Identity Object. Drive Wizard uses
  three of its sub-objects to determine whether an EDS file is the matching EDS
  file for the CAN node's object Dictionary. These sub-objects are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The CiA Vendor ID. <br>
    This is a unique 32 bit number assigned by
  the CiA to each registered CANopen vendor. Sevcon's vendor ID is.30. </p>
  <p align="left">The product code. <br>
    This is a 32 bit number sued to identify what
  type of device this CAN node is</p>
  <p align="left">The revision number. <br>
    This is a 32 bit number used to
    identity the revision of this CAN node e.g. an existing CAN Node could be upgraded
    and
    its
    object
    dictionary changed as part of this upgrade. In these circumstances the product
    code may stay the same but the revision number would be incremented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Drive Wizard requires that the Vendor ID, product code and
  revision number ALL match for it to associate an EDS file with a connected
  CAN node's Object dictionary.</p>
<h2 align="left">Device Configuration  files (DCFs)</h2>
<p align="left">A specialized variant of the EDS file can be created known
  as a DCF. The major differences between an
  EDS and a DCF are that the DCF file contains actual values for Object dictionary
  parameters
  and
  the
  DCF contains
  a back reference to the EDS on which it was based. Drive Wizard can create
  DCF files for any connected CANopen node. See <a href="../../DCF/DCf%20overview.htm">DCF</a></p>
