<p><br>
  Available options<br>
  There are two mechanical package options (Figure 2) for the espAC controller
  at each voltage and current rating. In self-cooled fromat, espAC operates built-in
  fans to control unit temperature. You can configure whether the fans operate
  on a full-time or on-demand basis.<br>

  Figure 2 Mechanical package options<br>
  For either package espAC is fully protected against short-term and long-term
  overloads by a function which temporarily reduces the maximum allowed torque
  demand when the power frame temperature or the power MOSFET junction temperatures
reach the maximum safe limits for the operating conditions of torque and speed.</p>
<p><br>
