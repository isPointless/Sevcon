<h2>Connection</h2>
<h3><a name="A1"></a>I have installed Drive Wizard . Now how do I connect to my vehicle</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText">See <a href="../Getting%20Started/the%20first%20time%20you%20run%20drive%20wizard.htm">The
    First time you use Drive Wizard</a></p>

<h2>Guided Processes</h2>
<h3><a name="A2"></a>The icon for the guided process I want to use is not visible<br>
  <a name="A4"></a>Drive Wizard allows me to open a guided Process but prevents
me from changing any values</h3>
<h3 class="DWbodyText">Drive Wizard displays the icons and or limits access
    to Guided Processes dependent on the current system
  configuration and the  users login level.<br>
  If
        you
      were expecting to see a Guided
      Process icon then
 you should check the following:</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Do I have enough access to perfrom this Guided Process? </strong><br>
  Some processes require
  a minimum Sevcon controller login level.
    This Sevcon is done automatically by Drive Wizard when you Click the Connect
    button.in
  the <a href="../Screen%20descriptions/profileselectionscreen.htm">Select
  Profiles Screen</a>. If in doubt check your system access in the Main Window
  Status bar and re-connect using the <a href="../Screen%20descriptions/options%20screen.htm">Options
screen Vehicle Profiles Tab</a></p>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Is this Guided Process applicable to this CANopen
    node?</strong><br>
  Some processes are only applicable to Sevcon controllers running application
    software. Look at the CAN node icon in the Structure
    Pane<br>
    Is this controller running Boot Loader or Self Characterization software?
    If so, it may need to be re-programmed.</p>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Does the CAN node need to be the CAN bus
    master</strong>.<br>
    A CAN node that is a bus master is indicated by a red outline on its icon.
    All other CAN nodes have a gray outline</p>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Is this guided Process applicable to this type
    of CAN node.</strong> <br>
  Some processes e.g. self
  characterization are only applicable to a motor controller and would not be
displayed e.g. for a pump controller</p>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Does this Guided Process require the system to
    be in pre-operational state?</strong><br>
  Some processes require all connected nodes to be in the pre-operational state.
     Try using the toolbar icon
    to
    request the CNA bus master to force the system to pre-operational. </p>
<p class="DWbodyText"><strong>Is anther Guided Process already running ?</strong><br>
  Some Guided Processes either change the System Structure and/or should not
    be interrupted e.g. reprogramming CAN nodes. Drive Wizard will prevent you
    from
    running
    other processes while these processes are running.</p>

<h2>Structure Pane View</h2>
<h3><span class="DWbodyText"><a name="A5"></a></span>Drive Wizard has found my CAN node but is not showing any
  infromation under
the CAN node icon</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText">A CAN nodes Object
    Dictionary can only be displayed if
  Drive Wizard can access a matching EDS for
  the CAN node. If this is a Sevcon CAN node then click on the CAN Node icon
  in the Structure Panel record the CiA Vendor ID, the Product Code and the revision
  number. The contact the supplier of the CAN Node and quote these values. For
  Sevcon CAN Nodes <a href="mailto:jude.wood@sevcon.com?Subject=EDS request">contact
 the Drive Wizard Team</a></p>
<h3><span class="DWbodyText"><a name="A6"></a></span>Drive Wizard is showing
  the wrong Object Dictionary structure under my CAN node icon</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText">The EDS provides infromation on every Object Dictionary
  parameter for  a matching CAN node. The
  EDS 
  is
  a flat structure and therefore  with large Object Dictionaries it can be difficult
  to locate a particular object. To overcome this, Drive Wizard applies
  an XML based tree structure to CAN nodes that have an associated EDS. <br>
  Sevcon
  controllers have detailed XML structures based on the function of each Object
  Dictionary object. This  infromation is not available for non-Sevcon
  CAN nodes and so Drive Wizard applies an XML structure based on the generic
  CANopen Object Dictionary structure. If you see a generic structure under a
  Sevcon node icon then the most likely reason is that an XML file has been deleted
  from your system. <a href="mailto:jude.wood@sevcon.com?Subject=XML file request">Contact
  the Drive Wizard Team</a> for a replacement quoting the
  CiA Vendor ID , product code and revision number of the CAN node.</p>
<h3><span class="DWbodyText"><a name="A7"></a></span>Drive Wizard prevents me from dragging
  an icon in the System Structure</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText">When you try to drag an icon Drive Wizard checks whether
  any suitable destinations exist for the current system (this is dependent on
  the vehicle mode, other active Drive Wizard processes and the user login
  level). If no suitable destinations exist then Drive Wizard will inhibit Drag&amp;Drop
  for this icon. Drive Wizard will display the inhibit reason in the Status bar. <br>
  Attempting to Drag an icon too quickly can occasionally prevent Drive Wizard
  from seeing the Drag&amp;Drop Request. If Drive Wizard does not display the Drag&amp;Drop
  inhibit
  explanation in the status bar then try Clicking and Dragging slightly slower. </p>
<h3><span class="DWbodyText"><a name="A8"></a></span>Drive Wizard prevents me
  from dropping an icon onto my destination</h3>
<p class="DWbodyText">When you drag an icon over a potential drop site Drive
  Wizard will evaluate when the this is a suitable destination. this is dependent
  on
  the vehicle modes, other active Drive Wizard processes and the user login
  level). If this is not a suitable destination then Drive Wizard will display
  the inhibit
  reason in the status bar.</p>
