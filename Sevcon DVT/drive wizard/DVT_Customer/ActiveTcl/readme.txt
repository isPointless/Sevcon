The files in this directory are:

ActiveTcl8.4.7.0-win32-ix86-108887.exe - Installation file for Active TCL. Run this first.
blt24z-for-tcl84.exe                   - Installation for BLT package. Required by DVT program.

When installing the BLT package (blt24z-for-tcl84.exe), make sure you install it in the same location
as Tcl is installed. The BLT installer defaults to c:\Program Files\Tcl, but Tcl normally installs to c:\Tcl.
If they are not in the same location, Tcl cannot find the package.
